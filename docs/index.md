## Concepts

The purpose of this document is to help members of the Praekelt and Girl Effect organisation get a deeper understanding of the structure, the functionality of the Girleffect.org website and itâ€™s CMS (Wagtail) components.

The document will attempt to outline Wagtail CMS components, how they look and work on the frontend interface.

The document will outline the following:
* Overall page types - review all the supported CMS pages components (These pages are dynamic therefore an emphasis is placed on the CMS rather than front end)
* Navigation Link:
*  Review CMS settings components and how they are surfaced on the frontend ie.
*     Navigation settings
*       Primary navigation links & sublinks
*       Secondary navigation links & sublinks
*       Footer navigation links OR external links
* Overall page streamfields
* Snippets - review all the supported CMS snippets types and how they apply to some pages e.g. Category snippet can be assigned to an Article Index page as well as Article page

# Stream fields

Stream fields are specialised content edit forms for CMS pages and often common across different page types.

Stream fields can be fixed content ie. simple text only e.g. Page Title, Introduction or Body streamfield etc. where text is interspersed.

This section will outline some of the common stream fields across the different pages.


**Title stream field:**

* Is a fixed short text title of a content module e.g. A page name
* This is a required field

**Hero Video stream field:**

Is a video and an image fallback banner component with caption, page links options and some color customisation.

* The Hero video streamfield support is for the Homepage and Solution page types
* The links can either be  a page link or youtube pop up modal call to action link


**The Hero Video streamfield is made up of the following elements:**

* **Hero video** - the recommended size 12Mb or under, however the CMS Media > Video upload feature does not validate against the following:
    * Media file size upload, I tested and successfully uploaded a 2,42 GB file
    * [Media file format](https://www.encoding.com/html5-video-codec/), I have uploaded an .mp4, Chromeâ€™s .WAP, .mkv etc.
    * NOTE: [Page speed](https://rankdefender.com/website-speed-matters/) and website performance optimization is up to the content owner to compress and upload assets of the recommended sizes.
* **Hero fallback image** - The full width image spec is 2400x1600px, jpeg or png saved for web, and optimized
    * [See guiding specs](https://flothemes.com/flothemes-image-sizes/)
    * Images can be compressed through TinyJPG before being uploaded to the CMS
    * Ideally the image weight should be less than 1Mb

* **Hero strapline** - 1 line caption  
* **Hero strapline hex** - add a custom caption text color.
    * [See color picker examples](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/)
* **Page Link** - A banner call to action click through. CHOOSE A PAGE link within the CMS
* YouTube Link - add a YT call to action click through a pop up modal
    * NOTE: You can only use either Page Link or YouTube Link as a time but not both destination
* **Link text** - text button call to action, if not added the banner will not surface a call to action on the frontend.
    * This is a required field
